Title: Analyze Genomic Loci and Match to Mutational Signatures
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Duccio Pagliai
Maintainer: Duccio Pagliai <ducciopagliai@gmail.com>
Description: A package for analyzing genomic loci, extracting their sequences 
    from a reference genome, and matching them to mutational signatures 
    (from COSMIC). This package provides tools to compute triplet 
    frequencies and rank mutational signatures by likelihood.
