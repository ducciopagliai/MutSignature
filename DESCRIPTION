Package: MutSignature
Title: Analyze genomic loci and match them to Mutational Signatures
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Duccio Pagliai
Maintainer: Duccio Pagliai <ducciopagliai@gmail.com>
Description: A package for analyzing genomic loci, extracting their DNA 
    sequences from a reference genome, and mapping them to mutational 
    signatures (from COSMIC). The package provides functions to count 
    triplet frequencies, either for each locus or by aggregating results, 
    and estimate the theoretical contribution of mutational signatures 
    to genomic loci.
