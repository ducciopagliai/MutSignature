\title{FUNCTION TO COUNT TRIPLETS AGGREGATED ACROSS ALL SEQUENCES}
\usage{
count_triplets_aggregated(triplet_counts)
}
\arguments{
\item{triplet_counts}{A list of triplet counts, where each element corresponds to a locus.
Each element is a named vector or table containing triplet counts for that locus.}
}
\value{
A named vector (as a table) representing the aggregated counts of all triplets across all loci.
}
\description{
This function takes triplet counts for each locus (as a list) and aggregates them across all loci,
returning a global count for all triplets.
}
\examples{
loci <- c("chr1:1000000-1000100", "chr2:2000000-2000100")
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)
sequence_df <- extract_sequences(loci, BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)
print(sequence_df)
triplet_counts <- count_triplets_per_locus(sequence_df)
print(triplet_counts)

global_triplet_counts <- count_triplets_aggregated(triplet_counts)
print(global_triplet_counts)
}
